# For contributors
## Things you need
- install npm and node : https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-install-node-js-and-npm-on-windows-2/
- github desktop app (this is recommended... unless you are okay with typing git commands in your terminal). 
- You must know basic git concepts like fork, clone, commit, pull requests, etc. If you don't know this then just take a crash course or something.
- quickly read this: https://medium.com/@jonathanmines/the-ultimate-github-collaboration-guide-df816e98fb67

## Get started
- clone this repo
- open a terminal in the cloned folder (or open cloned folder in vs code and start terminal from there). Then write this
```
npm install
```
- this installs all the necessary packages needed to run this website on system for development
- now run this command
```
npm run dev
```
- this will run the development server on `http://localhost:5173/` (just enter this in your browser url bar)
```
http://localhost:5173/
```
- you can see the changes you make to the file in real time (its recommended to turn on **autosave** in vscode)
- push changes to remote branch once your done (fancy way of saying push you code to online github storage, very easy to do with github desktop)
